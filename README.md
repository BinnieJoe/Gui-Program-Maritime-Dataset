# Maritime-Detection

This was conducted in an anaconda environment using airborne maritime drone data.

I trained and ran the YOLOv5 model directly in the Anaconda environment.
In order to actively utilize the YOLO model, 
you need the dataset you want and an understanding of yaml files.

Next, I will train the model by collecting and labeling direct data.
